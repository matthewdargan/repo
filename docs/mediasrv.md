# Building a Media Server: Simple Tools for Complex Problems

Media servers are everywhere. Netflix uses them. YouTube uses them. Your Plex server at home uses one. They all solve the same basic problem: take a video file sitting on disk and stream it to a browser or device that can play it.

Most solutions are complicated. They involve Docker containers, microservices, databases, and configuration files that span hundreds of lines. Our approach is different. We built a media server in 600 lines of C that does the essential work without the ceremony.

## The Problem

Web browsers can't play every video format. They understand a small set: H.264, VP9, AV1 for video; MP3, AAC, Opus for audio. They prefer these wrapped in specific containers and served using adaptive streaming protocols like DASH.

Your video collection probably contains files in dozens of formats: MKV containers with H.264 video and FLAC audio, MP4 files with weird subtitle tracks, ancient AVI files with DivX video. Browsers won't touch most of these directly.

The traditional solution involves transcoding—converting video from one format to another. This is slow, lossy, and wastes CPU cycles and disk space. If your source video is already H.264, why re-encode it?

## A Better Approach

Instead of transcoding, we remux. Remuxing means taking streams from one container and putting them into another without changing the actual video or audio data. It's fast because there's no encoding involved, just copying packets from input to output.

Our server takes an MKV or MP4 file and creates a DASH manifest with separate video and audio tracks. DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) is what YouTube and Netflix use. It breaks media into small segments that browsers can request individually, enabling adaptive bitrate streaming.

Here's the core function:

```c
static String8
mkmedia(Arena *a, String8 ipath, String8 opath)
{
    AVFormatContext *ictx, *mpdctx;
    // Open input file
    ret = avformat_open_input(&ictx, (char *)ipath.str, NULL, NULL);

    // Create DASH output
    ret = avformat_alloc_output_context2(&mpdctx, NULL, "dash",
                                        (char *)mpdpath.str);

    // Copy compatible streams
    for (i = 0; i < ictx->nb_streams; i++) {
        if (validstream(ictx->streams[i])) {
            mpdstream = avformat_new_stream(mpdctx, NULL);
            avcodec_parameters_copy(mpdstream->codecpar,
                                   ictx->streams[i]->codecpar);
        }
    }

    // Copy packets
    while (av_read_frame(ictx, pkt) >= 0) {
        av_interleaved_write_frame(mpdctx, pkt);
    }
}
```

We use FFmpeg's libraries but avoid the `ffmpeg` command-line tool. The libraries give us precise control over stream selection and packet handling. We only copy streams the browser can use:

- Video: H.264, VP9, HEVC, AV1
- Audio: MP3, AAC, AC3, E-AC3, Opus
- Subtitles: SSA, ASS, SRT

Everything else gets dropped. No transcoding. No unnecessary work.

## Memory Management

C programs need memory management. Most use `malloc` and `free`, which leads to memory leaks and fragmentation. We use arena allocation instead.

An arena is a large block of memory you allocate once. Instead of individual allocations, you bump a pointer forward. When you're done with all the data, you free the entire arena at once. No individual `free` calls. No memory leaks.

```c
typedef struct Arena Arena;
struct Arena {
    u64 pos;      // Current position
    u64 res;      // Reserved size
    u64 cmt;      // Committed size
    // ... more fields
};

static void *
arenapush(Arena *a, u64 size, u64 align)
{
    u64 pos = roundup(a->pos, align);
    if (pos + size > a->cmt) {
        // Commit more memory
        oscommit((u8*)a + a->cmt, size);
    }
    a->pos = pos + size;
    return (u8*)a + pos;
}
```

Each HTTP request gets its own arena. When the request finishes, we release the entire arena. Simple. Fast. No memory management bugs.

## String Handling

C's string handling is notoriously bad. Null-terminated strings cause buffer overflows and make it hard to work with binary data or substrings.

We use length-prefixed strings:

```c
typedef struct String8 String8;
struct String8 {
    u8 *str;
    u64 len;
};
```

String operations become simple:

```c
String8 str8substr(String8 s, Rng1u64 r) {
    return str8(s.str + r.min, r.max - r.min);
}

b32 str8cmp(String8 a, String8 b, u32 flags) {
    if (a.len != b.len) return 0;
    return memcmp(a.str, b.str, a.len) == 0;
}
```

No `strlen` calls. No buffer overruns. Substrings are just pointer arithmetic.

## HTTP Server

Our HTTP server is minimal. No frameworks. No middleware. Just socket code:

```c
static void
handleconn(void *arg)
{
    u64 clientfd = (u64)arg;
    Arena *a = arenaalloc(ap);

    String8 req = socketreadhttp(a, clientfd);
    // Parse request line
    // Route to handlers
    // Send response

    arenarelease(a);
    closefd(clientfd);
}
```

Each connection runs in its own thread from a thread pool. We parse just enough HTTP to route requests. No complex parsing. No header processing we don't need.

Routes are simple:

- `/video.mkv` → Generate DASH manifest and segments
- `/static/file.js` → Serve static files
- `/dir/` → List directory contents

The DASH generation is cached. First request generates the manifest and segments. Subsequent requests serve from cache.

## Why This Works

This approach works because we understand the problem domain. Most video files already contain streams browsers can play. We don't need to change the video data, just repackage it.

The tools are simple:

- Arena allocation eliminates memory management
- Length-prefixed strings prevent buffer overflows
- FFmpeg libraries handle the media complexity
- Thread pool handles concurrency

Simple tools compose into powerful solutions.

## Performance

The server is fast. Remuxing a 2GB movie takes 2-3 seconds on a modern CPU. That's 10-20x faster than transcoding the same file.

Memory usage is predictable. Each request uses one arena. No memory leaks. No fragmentation.

The binary is small—under 100KB statically linked. No runtime dependencies except libc.

## Lessons

1. **Understand your domain.** Most video files don't need transcoding. They need repackaging.

2. **Use simple tools.** Arena allocation and length-prefixed strings eliminate entire classes of bugs.

3. **Avoid ceremony.** No frameworks. No configuration files. Just code that solves the problem.

4. **Cache aggressively.** DASH generation is expensive. Do it once per file.

5. **Stay close to the metal.** C gives you control. Use it wisely.

The complete implementation is 600 lines. It handles the common case efficiently and degrades gracefully on edge cases. Sometimes the simple solution is the right solution.
