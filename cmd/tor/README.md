# Tor

Tor queries for torrents.

Usage:

    tor [-f filter] [-c category] [-u user] [-s sort] [-o order] <-q query>

The -f flag sets the filter. Available options include: 0 (No filter),
1 (No remakes), 2 (Trusted only). The default setting is 0.

The -c flag sets the category. The default setting is 0_0 (All
categories).

The -u flag sets the user. The default setting does not set a specific
user.

The -s flag sets the sort method. Available sort methods include:
comments, size, id (date), seeders, leechers, downloads. The default
setting sorts by date.

The -o flag sets the sorting order. The order can be set to ascending
(asc) or descending (desc). The default setting does not set an order.

The -q flag sets the query. This is a required argument.

## Example

    tor -f '1' -c '1_2' -u 'user 1' -s 'downloads' -o 'desc' -q 'One Piece'
